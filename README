id3reset is supposed to (re)set the artist, album and track ID3 tags of MP3 files according to the directories they are located in and their filenames. 

For example if there is a file
  mp3s/Artist1/Album1/Track1.mp3
and id3reset is called with
  id3reset mp3s
the file will get Artist1 as artist, Album1 as album and Track1.mp3 as track.

id3reset relies on exactly this hierarchy (artist/album/track). It does not recurse into directories deeper as album and it doesn't modify files that are directly in the artist directory itself.

I created this programm because my MP3-player is solely using the ID3 tags to navigate thru the files and completely ignores the directory structure, but I rather want to navigate thru the directories.

Compiling
id3reset depends on TagLib. There should be some package like libtagc0-dev for your distribution.
